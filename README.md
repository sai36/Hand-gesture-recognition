# Hand-gesture-recognition
During this pandemic situation(Covid-19), the need for continuing the hospital
services by reducing the contact with humans is given top most importance. Applications
like Furhat becomes increasingly useful in this case. Virtual Furhat
application helps the humans to contact with our receptionist(Furhat) whitout
even touching the screen just by using hand gestures for communication.

We demonstrate an application system to book an appointment using the virtual
version of Furhat. Furhat interacts with virtual patients through hand gestures in
the video. We use an OpenCV model to detect the key points in the videos and
recognize the hand gesture with the detected key points using a machine learning
model multi-layer perceptron(MLP). We then describe how we can integrate these
models with Furhat using Kotlin. At last, we propose an end-to-end integration
learning system to implement this task.
